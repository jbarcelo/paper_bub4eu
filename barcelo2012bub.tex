% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{./figures/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

This paper offers an overview of the Commons for Europe (C4EU) project and the role of Bottom-up Broadband (BuB) in developing the information society.
BuB is characterized by the fact that the beneficiaries of the networks actively participate in the planning, deployment and maintenance tasks.
For the beneficiaries, this represent a paradigm shift from a consumer-only position to an active-participant position.

We summarize a representative set of the BuB pilot proposals that have been considered in the context of the C4EU project.
A selection of these proposals will be executed and carefully documented to define good practices in BuB deployments.
The documentation will include project templates, work plans, case studies, replicable success models and regulatory guidelines.

The overall goal of the project is to assess the validity of the BuB model to effectively and efficiently complement exiting traditional deployments in satisfying the networking and technological needs of the European citizens and organizations.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
The role of the broadband information networks is gaining importance as the information society develops.
Broadband access means access to a plethora of multimedia educational resources, collaboration opportunities and productivity tools that empower our society.
Ideally, broadband services should be accessible to all the citizens independently of their age, education, economical status or geographical distribution.

With this goal, several community networks have appeared to promote the access to broadband in highly collaborative scenarios.
This community networks are typically led by technology enthusiasts but they attract a mass of participants which are, initially, not necessarily technologically savvy. 
Nevertheless, the high degree of participation and interaction between the participants create the right environment for knowledge transfer and many of the users involved in this community networks quickly acquire basic or advanced networking skills.

Some public institutions, typically municipalities, have been compelled to offer basic networking services to their citizens and visitors in the form of hotspots.
Even though these services are very limited, they are greatly appreciated by the users that perceive that there is a great value in broadband connectivity.

There is a desire to extend and complement current network deployment efforts, find easy replicable success models and establish collaborations among highly heterogeneous groups that share similar goals.
In this context, the \emph{Commons for Europe} European project aims to be a catalyzer that make possible the collaboration among these groups and establishes the necessary documentation, methodology, and good practices to ease and replicate Bottom-up-Broadband (BuB) network deployments that ultimately benefit European citizens.

The particularity of BuB is the active role the individuals and organizations that are the beneficiaries of the network in the network planning, funding, deployment and maintenance.
\section{Common Resources}
Common resources, or \emph{commons} for short, are shared by communities for efficiency reasons.
The \emph{Commons for Europe} (C4EU) project explores the effectiveness of commons in two particular areas or branches: software and networking.
To be more specific, the interest of the software branch is on simple applications (such as web applications or mobile applications) that can be used by different cities to improve the quality of life of their citizens and make a better use of the public resources.
The spirit of the project is to encourage the participation and implication of the citizens in making their city a better place to live.
A recurrent example is the application \emph{adopt a hydrant} in which citizens take responsibility for shoveling out a fire hydrant after it snows.
This eases the task of firemen in case there is a fire in the neighbourhood.

The other aspect of interest in the C4EU project is Bottom-up Broadband (BuB).
The aim of BuB is to deploy networks and networking services that can be used as a common resource.
A paradigmatic success story of the use of commons in networking is the allocation of the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands.
It is mentioned in \cite{abramson2009asw} that Michael Marcus proposed in the eighties the establishment of unlicensed bands as a commons resource.
The availability of this bands has spurred the growth of the wireless industry making possible the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) technologies that are in widespread use nowadays.

Note that this particular example is exposed to \emph{the tragedy of the commons}.
The tragedy of the commons is a well studied situation in which the members of a community over-exploit a common resource and substantially reduce its value.
In the case of ISM bands, if the number of transmissions grows too high, the resultant interference will render the network unusable.

Even though the tragedy of the commons occurs in certain busy locations at busy hours, it is generally considered that the advantages of having a commons spectrum band clearly outweigh the disadvantages.

Another good example commons in networking is optical fiber deployment.
Deploying the cable can have a high cost, but every cable has multitude (e.g., 96) fibers.
After deploying the cable, some of these fibers may remain unused and the owner may decide to offer them as a common resource in order to facilitate the growth of the network.

A recurrent statement in networking is that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes (Metcalfe's Law).
It is true in many situations that adding new nodes to a network represents a win-win situation for all the participants.
If this is the case, the owners of the network may be willing to offer their own network resources as commons, as the value of their network will increase when others connect to it.

The BuB branch of the C4EU project is devoted to the exploration of network initiatives in which different individuals and organizations team up to create and extend data networks using common resources.

The idea of commons can take many different forms: common infrastructure, common cabling, common hardware, common bandwidth, common spectrum, common knowledge, etc.

\section{Technologies of interest}

In the project, four different technologies have been considered: WiFi, fibre optics, sensors and SuperWiFi.
WiFi technology has allowed the deployment of large networks at a low cost.
WiFi equipment is widely available and hackers have used to interconnect nodes that carry the network traffic over long distances.
If the density of nodes is low (rural areas), highly directive links can be used to cover long distances.
When the density of nodes is higher, the nodes can use less directive antennas to reach and receive data from several nodes.

The amount of bandwidth available in radio links is subject to interference and weather conditions.
Since the ISM spectrum is a finite resource, there is a natural limit in the amount of bandwidth available with this technology.

For this reason, fibre optics is also a technology under consideration in BuB deployments.
The bandwidth available using optical links is orders of magnitude larger than that of WiFi.
Furthermore, links are more stable and are not affected by the interference or the weather.
Compared to wireless, deploying a fibre optics link is much more expensive.
Nevertheless, if this link can be used as a commons resource, fibre optics can be economically viable.
Furthermore, it may be the case that there are already publicly owned fibers that can be used as a commons resource.

Another technology under consideration is sensor networks.
Quite often, sensor nodes are battery-powered devices with limited communication capabilities.
Strictly speaking, they do not represent a broadband technology.
Nevertheless, given the possibility and the interest by some organizations to deploy their own sensor networks in a bottom-up fashion, we have included them in our study of bottom-up networking.

The novelty of this technology makes it difficult to find existing success models in which it is used as commons.
The C4EU project should be helpful in defining this models.
As an example, an entity interested in gathering street parking information could collaborate with an entity interested in gathering pollution data and deploy the network as a common resource.
An interesting aspect regarding sensor networks is that the data itself can be offered as a common resource to allow independent developers to built applications using that data.

Finally, the last considered technology is SuperWiFi, which attempts to reproduce the success of WiFi at a different frequency band.
In particular, SuperWifi operates at lower frequencies (TV white spaces).
The idea is to use the spectrum unused by TV channels as a commons.
The problem is that the equipment should comply with very strict requirement to prevent the interference with licensed users.

The advantages of SuperWiFi compared to regular WiFi is that at lower frequencies we have larger coverage areas and better in-building penetration.
Increased coverage has also the downside of higher interference.

Super-WiFi & Future technology, wireless, medium throughput, longer propagation distance and better penetration compared to WiFi, co-existence with incumbent networks.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Some of the considered deployments include more than one of the above mentioned technologies.
An example of a BuB network combining fiber optics, WiFi and mesh technologies is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:hybrid}.
\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hybrid}
\caption{An hybrid BuB deployment combining different technologies.}
\label{fig:hybrid}
\end{figure}

Besides technology, there is also an interest in the C4EU project to explore regulatory issues.
Regulation can deeply impact the ways in which BuB can be used and deployed.
Our intention is to obtain results that can help policymakers to decide which are the regulatory directions that lead to a greater benefit for the population.

\section{Bottom-up Broadband}

BuB networks are characterized by the implication of the beneficiaries in the planning, funding, deployment and maintenance of the network.
The beneficiaries do not necessarily have to be the end users.
The broad term beneficiaries refers to any person or organization that is interested in the availability of broadband services.

Quite often, particular users take the initiative to participate in the network deployment.
But there are also many examples of private companies and public administrations that are interested in the presence of BuB services and actively contribute to the network.

It is also perfectly possible that the backers of BuB network represent a heterogeneous group, with completely different goals, that share a common interest in the deployment of the network.

Deploying a broadband network is not an easy task.
It requires substantial amounts of money, time and know-how.
To be successful, a BuB network requires a team that combines these three ingredients.
Naturally, it requires a clear commitment by part of the all the network promoters, which is a very important step in a BuB deployment.
The goal of the C4EU project is to help to organize, publicize and transfer the  BuB know how among those that already have the other two ingredients to engage in a BuB initiative.

It is normal that people that is not familiar with BuB networks to be reluctant to accept that it is possible to deploy broadband networks following a collaborative approach.
For this reason, the first BuB initiatives should be oriented to achieve \emph{quick wins}.
A \emph{quick win} is a small, not particularly ambitious, project that can be successfully completed in a short time.
The completion of a \emph{quick win} will provide the necessary confidence to get involved in larger, more complex projects.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{success_wheel}
\caption{Success by recursion.}
\label{fig:success_wheel}
\end{figure}

This approach has been termed \emph{success by recursion} and it is graphically represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:success_wheel}.
It differentiates three main steps for each project: description, review \& financial commitment, and execution.
The emphasis is placed in the fact that the successful completion of one project triggers the beginning of another one.

\section{Methodology}

The planning of the C4EU project includes two differentiated phases: BuB pilots and BuB long term sustainability.
In the first phase selected BuB pilots will be executed with the help and under the supervision of the participants of the C4EU project.
The intention is to run several pilots in different cities and using different technologies across Europe.
Each of these pilots should have a strong backing from local institutions and local champions that should make it possible that they can progress autonomously after the first steps.

The second phase, which is much more ambitious, is the creation of a community that can continue the work started by the C4EU project in the long term.
This community, with the help of the know-how gathered during the C4EU, should be able to continue to provide advice and support for the creation of new BuB pilots after the C4EU project has finished.

The first step has been the dissemination of a call for pilot proposal in which the participants of the project have identified and documented potential pilots to be executed within the C4EU project.

To systematize the information gathering process, we have created a pilot proposal template that contains the following relevant information about the project:

A second call for pilots is programmed for the second year of the project. 
The call for pilots and the gathered information offers a picture of the state of Bottom-up Broadband initiatives in Europe.
More information about the C4EU project, the call for pilots and the pilot proposals can be found in \cite{barcelo2012bpp}.

\section{BuB Pilot Proposals}
This section offers a very short summary of the twelve pilot proposals that we have received in answer to the call for pilots.
Note that in this paper we present only a very brief excerpt of every BuB proposal for conciseness. 
More details are available in the technical project \cite{barcelo2012bpp}.
Table~\ref{tab:pilot_opportunities} summarizes the different pilot proposals and classifies them by technology.

\subsection{FCMOSNET}
FCMOSNET stands for FC United Moston Community Stadium Network and it has been proposed by the Manchester Digital Development Agenda (MDDA).
The goal is to create a BuB network that combines optical fibre and WiFi technologies around a new stadium built by the ``Football Club United of Manchester''.
This network should provide low-cost or free WiFi and low-cost fibre Internet connections to the members of the community.

\subsection{NQN}
NQN stands for Northern Quarter Net and has also been proposed by the MDDA.
The goal is to offer a public WiFi service which uses low-cost equipment and an existing high-speed fibre Internet connection.
NQN is being constructed as an Industrial Provident Society (IPS), which is an organization conducting an industry, business or trade in the form of a cooperative or for the benefit of a community.

\subsection{Hulme High Street}
This is the third pilot proposal by the MDDA and it is very similar in nature to the above mentioned NQN.

\subsection{CAC}
CAC stands for Catalonia's Audiovisual Council and the goal of this pilot is to use the available spectrum from the digital dividend to broadcast IPTV content using SuperWiFi.
The broadcast will have a limited geographical coverage and it is aimed to serve the interests of local communities.
This pilot has been proposed by Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

\subsection{PRBB}
PRBB is the Barcelona's Biomedical Research Parc, which hosts a combination of public laboratories and private spin-offs.
While the public laboratories are entitled to access a local public research network, the private spin-offs need an alternative to reach the Internet.
The availability of public fiber deployments in the neighborhood of the park makes it possible to implement a commons model to provide high-speed connectivity.
This pilot has been proposed by \emph{guifi.net}.

\subsection{OpenWisp}
OpenWisp is a project initiated by the Province of Rome to extend the opportunities of the citizens to access broadband Internet.
This service is publicized with the name \emph{ProvinciaWiFi} and makes use of free software tools and open standards combined with low-cost hardware.
It has deployed several hundreds of access points that offer access to registered users in public locations.
The platform is offered as a commons resource for others to replicate and collaborate.
This project has been jointly proposed by Provincia di Roma and CASPUR.

\subsection{EuropeWiFi}
The idea of this project is to replicate the success model of ProvinciaWiFi and construct a RADIUS hierarchy similar to the existing EduRoam to make it possible for the users to make use of the public Internet access when they visit other cities or countries.
The goal is to build a pan-European public WiFi solution relying on free software, open standards and low-cost hardware.
This project is also promoted by CASPUR and Provincia di Roma.

\subsection{Gurb}
Gurb is a village that has already carried out a first phase of BuB fibre optics deployment.
This pilot represents a second phase of the deployment that re-uses municipality-owned infrastructure.
This initiatives are described with the acronym FFTF which means Fiber From The Farm.
The emphasis is placed in the fact that the deployment starts from the farm, making it clear that it is a truly BuB initiative.
The organization that orchestrates the deployment is called GurbTec.

\subsection{Rubi}
Rubi is a medium-sized city (ca. 75,000 inhabitants) and there is interest in starting a BuB deployment to cover both industrial and residential areas.
This will be a Fiber From The Home (FFTH) deployment and the intention is to start with a small project that can be executed in a few months to provide a \emph{quick win} and gather support for new phases of the project that further extend the network.
The promoters include an heterogeneous group of citizens, business and public administration.

\subsection{Vic}
Vic is a small city (ca. 40,000 inhabitants) interested in a BuB FFTH deployment to offer services to citizens, schools and businesses.
The promoters are two groups called Gaufix and Gurbtec.

\subsection{SensorWifi}
The idea of this pilot is to re-use the existing coverage offered by ProvinciaWiFi to gather data from sensors deployed across the city.
In this case, the WiFi infrastructure is the commons resource to be shared by different services and applications.
This pilot proposal has been suggested by CASPUR and Provincia di Roma.

\subsection{Open Sensor Network}
The goal of this pilot is to construct a platform to collect and share real-time information gathered by sensors.
If this information is publicly available can be re-used by application developers to create imaginative applications (typically web applications or mobile applications) that will be useful to the citizens.

\section{Pilot Planning Template}
In this section we include and example pilot planning template for a BuB deployment. 
Obviously, every BuB initiative is different and the example template will need to be adapted to the requirements of each deployment.
Nevertheless, this template can be used as a guideline and checklist to make sure that no important step has been skipped.
A more detailed plan which includes the duration of each task and inter-dependencies in provided in the technical report \cite{barcelo2012bpp}.


\begin{itemize}
  \item{Warm-up:} 
  The first task involves gathering information regarding the deployment, a first draft of a high-level deployment plan and commitment from the leaders of the participating organizations.
  This previous initial agreement is a fundamental step, and a requisite to start working on the details of the deployment.
  \item{Project plan:}
  The second task is to prepare a detailed working plan.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Scope definition:}
    At this point, specific goals for the project will be settled.
    In general, it is advisable to aim for a \emph{quick win} by setting realistic goals that can be achieved in a short period of time.
    \item{Project development:}
    All the necessary steps to reach the defined goals might be carefully documented.
    This documentation will be used as input for the next task.
  \end{itemize}
  \item{Project review \& commitment:}
  At this point, project plan will be either accepted for execution or rejected.
  An acceptance means continuing with the next task while a rejection implies moving back to the Project Plan task to prepare a refined version of the documentation that can be approved in a subsequent round.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Identify stakeholders:}
    At this stage, all the people involved in the deployment should be identified.
    This includes the users, the professionals that work on the deployment and the service providers, and, finally the investors.
    The acceptance of the project is confirmed by the financial commitment from part of the investors.
    After that, the project is ready for execution.
  \end{itemize}
  \item{Execution:}
  In this task is where the actual deployment occurs.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Provisioning:}
    Obtaining all the required equipment and tools for the deployment.
    It is recommended to test and configure the equipment at this stage in a controlled environment.
    \item{Deployment:}
    Installation of cables, antennas and networking devices.
    \item{Wholesale access:}
    The working network is connected to an upstream provider to the Internet.
    \item{Legal \& compliance:}
    Some deployments may require notification to an authority or regulator, or other legal and bureaucratic procedures.
  \end{itemize}
  \item{Start operations:}
  At this point the network is ready to start operations.
  \item{Project Management:}
  This task spans throughout the all project and includes the supervision and necessary corrections to steer the direction of the project.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Regulatory Aspects}

%BuB deployments present not only technical challenges, but also regulatory changes.
%Even though the commons concept is contemplated in legal frameworks, so far few initiatives have considered its application to broadband networks.
%The novelty of BuB deployments requires exploration, clarification and education.
%One of the goals of the C4EU is to offer documentation and advice to both the promoters of BuB and the authorities 

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
